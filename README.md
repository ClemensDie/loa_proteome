# Analysis of plasma proteomes of *loaloa* infected patients in Gabon.

This repository contains analysis scripts regarding the loa loa proteome.

Loiasis, caused by the filarial nematode Loa loa, imposes a significant disease burden in endemic regions in West and Central Africa. Manifestations include microfilaria in the blood (MF) and migration of the adult eye worm (EW), ranging from asymptomatic infections to life-threatening organ involvement. Diagnosis remains challenging due to variable microfilaria counts, frequent amicrofilaraemia, and unreliable serological tests. Using high-throughput plasma proteomics, we investigated host responses of 274 patients with different disease presentations (INF), including EW, MF, or both (EWMF), compared to 136 loa-negative (LN) controls. Five proteins, including IGHG3, IGHG4, and LCP1, were elevated in INF; 4 increased from LN to EW to MF and EWMF, indicating a more pronounced host response to microfilaraemia. Moreover, IGHG4 correlated with eosinophil and microfilaria counts underscoring its role in chronic parasitic infections. 63 proteins differed depending on self-reported symptoms. The proteomic signatures enabled accurate classification of EW (AUROC = 0.73) and microfilaraemic (0.84) individuals. Overall, L. loa infection significantly alters the host plasma proteome, emphasizing the importance of comprehensive research on this highly neglected parasitic disease.
