    abstract = {Background Loiasis–a filarial disease endemic in Central and West Africa–is increasingly recognized as significant individual and public health concern. While the understanding of the disease characteristics remains limited, significant morbidity and excess mortality have been demonstrated. Here, we characterize clinical and hematological findings in a large cohort from Gabon.   Methods Loiasis-related clinical manifestations and microfilaremia, hemoglobin and differential blood counts were recorded prospectively during a cross-sectional survey. For analysis, participants were categorized into distinct infection states by the diagnostic criteria of eye worm history and microfilaremia.   Results Analysis of data from 1,232 individuals showed that occurrence of clinical and hematological findings differed significantly between the infection states. Eye worm positivity was associated with a wide range of clinical manifestations while microfilaremia by itself was not. Loa loa infection was associated with presence of eosinophilia and absolute eosinophil counts were associated with extent of microfilaremia (p-adj. = 0.012, ß-estimate:0.17[0.04–0.31]).   Conclusions Loiasis is a complex disease, causing different disease manifestations in patients from endemic regions. The consequences for the affected individuals or populations as well as the pathophysiological consequences of correlating eosinophilia are largely unknown. High-quality research on loiasis should be fostered to improve patient care and understanding of the disease.},

               transmitted by blood-sucking flies of the genus Chrysops.
               Loiasis primarily affects rural populations residing in the
               forest and adjacent savannah regions of central and west Africa,
               where more than 20 million patients are chronically infected in
               medium and high transmission regions. For a long time, loiasis
               has been regarded as a relatively benign condition. However,
               morbidity as measured by disability-adjusted life-years lost
               might be as high as 400 per 100 000 residents, and the
               population attributable fraction of death is estimated at 14·5\%
               in highly endemic regions, providing unequivocal evidence for
               the substantial disease burden that loiasis exerts on affected
               communities. The clinical penetrance of loiasis is variable and
               might present with the classic signs of eye worm migration or
               transient Calabar swellings, but might include common,
               unspecific symptoms or rare but potentially life-threatening
               complications. Although adult worm migration seems most closely
               linked to symptomatic disease, high levels of microfilaraemia
               are associated with clinically important complications and
               death. Loiasis remains difficult to diagnose, treat, and control
               due to an absence of reliable point-of-care diagnostic assays,
               safe and efficacious drugs, and cost-effective prevention
               strategies. This Review summarises the major advances in our
               understanding of loiasis made over the past decade and
               highlights the many gaps that await to be addressed urgently.",

	abstract = {Aging is a fundamental risk factor for a wide array of diseases. The Berlin Aging Study II (BASE-II) is a cohort study designed to investigate the physical, mental, and social determinants of successful aging. We utilized high-throughput mass spectrometry to measure the proteomes of 1890 BASE-II participants, divided into two age groups: 27-37 years and 60-85 years. We employed multiple linear regression analyses to explore the effects of demographic factors such as age, sex, and BMI, along with hormonal treatments and lifestyle factors, on the serum proteome. We identify new associations and confirm previously described proteins linked to age, sex, BMI and hormonal contraceptive use (HCU). Notably, we observed that the abundance of nutrient transport proteins, particularly apolipoproteins, is linked to metabolic diseases in aged individuals, including metabolic syndrome and type 2 diabetes. Additionally, we identified specific alterations explained by lifestyle factors, such as smoking and alcohol consumption. We further report a significant proteome signature in female study participants corresponding to menopause hormone replacement therapy (MHT). We successfully classified these participants based on MHT status with an AUROC of 0.82 using two proteins, Complement Component 9 and Plasminogen, slightly outperforming estradiol (AUROC: 0.80), the active ingredient in most MHT preparations. Overall, our study underscores the impact of lifestyle and hormonal therapies on the serum proteome during aging, primarily affecting components of the immune system and metabolism.Competing Interest StatementMarkus Ralser is founder and shareholder of Eliptica Ltd.

	abstract = {Background Plasma proteomics offers new avenues to explore non-genetic associations, such as biomarkers for lifestyle and environmental exposure in population studies. To date, most proteomic investigations in population studies have utilized affinity-reagent based technologies, which are ideal to quantify the low abundant fraction of the circulating proteome but may omit several of the abundant proteins that function in plasma.Methods Utilizing high throughput mass spectrometry, we quantified 148 highly abundant protein groups including immunoglobulins, coagulation factors, metabolic proteins, and components of the innate immune system, in the plasma of 3,632 participants from the Cooperative Health Research in South Tyrol (CHRIS) study. Using multiple regression analyses we then investigated associations with various factors including common medications.Results Beyond age and sex, the high abundant plasma proteome is predominantly influenced by hormonal contraceptives. For instance, Angiotensinogen (AGT) levels exhibit significant alteration with this treatment, suggesting that AGT levels could be a potential biomarker for contraceptive use. The effect of this drug class is more pronounced than other common medications or covariates. Furthermore, our analysis does not reveal any enduring signature associated with the use of these contraceptives.Conclusion In contrast to most used drugs, hormonal contraceptives exert a pronounced effect on the high abundant plasma proteome. Given its high prevalence among young female participants, the impact of hormonal contraceptives might be misconstrued as sex-or age-related effects on the plasma proteome. One should thus account for their use in any epidemiological or clinical plasma proteome study to prevent misleading results.Competing Interest StatementMarkus Ralser is founder and shareholder of Elitptica Ltd.
