    abstract = {Background Loiasis–a filarial disease endemic in Central and West Africa–is increasingly recognized as significant individual and public health concern. While the understanding of the disease characteristics remains limited, significant morbidity and excess mortality have been demonstrated. Here, we characterize clinical and hematological findings in a large cohort from Gabon.   Methods Loiasis-related clinical manifestations and microfilaremia, hemoglobin and differential blood counts were recorded prospectively during a cross-sectional survey. For analysis, participants were categorized into distinct infection states by the diagnostic criteria of eye worm history and microfilaremia.   Results Analysis of data from 1,232 individuals showed that occurrence of clinical and hematological findings differed significantly between the infection states. Eye worm positivity was associated with a wide range of clinical manifestations while microfilaremia by itself was not. Loa loa infection was associated with presence of eosinophilia and absolute eosinophil counts were associated with extent of microfilaremia (p-adj. = 0.012, ß-estimate:0.17[0.04–0.31]).   Conclusions Loiasis is a complex disease, causing different disease manifestations in patients from endemic regions. The consequences for the affected individuals or populations as well as the pathophysiological consequences of correlating eosinophilia are largely unknown. High-quality research on loiasis should be fostered to improve patient care and understanding of the disease.},

  abstract  = "Loa loa, the African eye worm, is a filarial pathogen
               transmitted by blood-sucking flies of the genus Chrysops.
               Loiasis primarily affects rural populations residing in the
               forest and adjacent savannah regions of central and west Africa,
               where more than 20 million patients are chronically infected in
               medium and high transmission regions. For a long time, loiasis
               has been regarded as a relatively benign condition. However,
               morbidity as measured by disability-adjusted life-years lost
               might be as high as 400 per 100 000 residents, and the
               population attributable fraction of death is estimated at 14·5\%
               in highly endemic regions, providing unequivocal evidence for
               the substantial disease burden that loiasis exerts on affected
               communities. The clinical penetrance of loiasis is variable and
               might present with the classic signs of eye worm migration or
               transient Calabar swellings, but might include common,
               unspecific symptoms or rare but potentially life-threatening
               complications. Although adult worm migration seems most closely
               linked to symptomatic disease, high levels of microfilaraemia
               are associated with clinically important complications and
               death. Loiasis remains difficult to diagnose, treat, and control
               due to an absence of reliable point-of-care diagnostic assays,
               safe and efficacious drugs, and cost-effective prevention
               strategies. This Review summarises the major advances in our
               understanding of loiasis made over the past decade and
               highlights the many gaps that await to be addressed urgently.",
